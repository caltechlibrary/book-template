## Membrane
The fundamental unit of life is the **cell**–a contained self-replicating assembly. For many species, including all bacteria and archaea, the organism consists of a single cell. And for nearly all species, no matter how many cells an organism eventually contains (probably around 10 trillion in your case), it started life as a single cell. The details vary, but every cell on Earth is the same at heart–a DNA-based replicating machine built from just four macromolecules:  nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. In the environment, molecules interact rarely and randomly. Bringing them together enables the reproducible reactions required for life. So no matter what the first self-replicating molecules were (likely <u>r</u>ibo<u>n</u>ucleic <u>a</u>cid, or RNA), they were not a cell until they acquired a container.

How would you build a container for a cell? You would probably want a flexible material that allowed you to sort specific molecules from the environment. Evolution agrees. All cells are enclosed by a selectively permeable **membrane**, made of lipids and proteins [Schematic: Lipid bilayer](#Lipid_bilayer), that allows them to differentiate their contents from the environment. The chemical properties of lipids make membranes impermeable to ions and large or hydrophilic molecules (but not to water). Cells take advantage of this property to establish an ion gradient across the membrane, using a chain of electron-carrying proteins in the membrane to pump protons out of the cell. Protein complexes in the membrane called ATP synthases use the resulting ion potential to generate energy that is chemically stored in ATP, the energetic currency of the cell. For this reason, we say that the membrane is “energized.” Holes in the membrane allow the ion gradient to equilibrate, destroying the cell’s means of generating energy, and thus its life.

Now your cell has a clearly delineated exterior and interior. The interior is called the **cytoplasm** ("cell substance,” from the Latin for something molded, in this case by the membrane). Almost all archaea and many bacteria, like these *Mycoplasma genitalium* cells, are **monoderms** ("single skin"). This means that their cytoplasm is enclosed by a single membrane. At this resolution, the membrane looks like a single dark line, but remember that it is really a bilayer, as you will be able to see in some later examples. The cytoplasm contains the many macromolecules that carry out the various functions of the cell's metabolism. The most prominent are the ribosomes which produce new proteins [Schematic: Ribosome](#Ribosome).

Other structures you see in this cell function in motility and will be explained in Chapter 6. Remember that tomograms show cells in their entirety, so the example we choose to illustrate one feature will likely highlight others as well. For now, focus on the feature being discussed. Later, when you have learned about other features, you may want to see additional examples of them. Then you can use the [Feature Index] to find them. To help orient you, feature labels in movies are color-coded according to the chapter in which they are discussed.

[*PDB: 6RIB*](http://rcsb.org/structure/6RIB)
Bactofilins are found in many species of bacteria and archaea, suggesting that they perform diverse (and currently unknown) functions. They polymerize into very stable filaments with a triangular beta-helical structure, like this one from *Thermus thermophilus* [@deng2019]. Bactofilin filaments lack two hallmarks of actin- and tubulin-based cytoskeletal elements: polarity and dynamic assembly/disassembly. In this way, they are similar to intermediate filaments in eukaryotic cytoskeletons.
