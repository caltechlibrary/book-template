There are many flavors of markdown, we'll start with standard markdown and then add some specific rmarkdown information. Let's look at some other basics: You can put text into italics and bold using * or ** To create headings, put one or more # symbols at the beginning of a line, followed by a space. One # is for a level one header, ## for a level two header, etc. To make bullet lists (such as this one), just start lines with a -; you can get additional levels by starting a line a couple of spaces or a tab in. Numbered lists work the same way using 1. 2. 3. - Topic 1 - Topic 2 - Topic 3 - Topic 3a To cite code (including markdown syntax as above) use ` on both sides for short bits and ``` in a separate line above and below larger codeblocks. Quote text using &gt; at the beginning of the line (maybe you remember this from old e-mail programs?) &gt; This is a Quote A link is set putting the text that you want to highlight in square brackets followed by the link in round brackets. Don't forget to include http:// or https:// at the beginning of the link [This is a link](http://www.example.com) You can find more markdown formatting options here. Note that markdown comes in different dialects, referred to as &quot;flavors&quot;. The basic elements above are part of a consensus referred to as Common Markdown, though some of the more advanced options we'll discuss later are specific to Rmarkdown. "],

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 2. 2.3 Including Code and Images Schematic: Bactofilin PDB: 6RIB Bactofilins are found in many species of bacteria and archaea, suggesting that they perform diverse (and currently unknown) functions. They polymerize into very stable filaments with a triangular beta-helical structure, like this one from Thermus thermophilus [1]. Bactofilin filaments lack two hallmarks of actin- and tubulin-based cytoskeletal elements: polarity and dynamic assembly/disassembly. In this way, they are similar to intermediate filaments in eukaryotic cytoskeletons. 2.4 LaTeX 2.5 Caltech Custom Features If you have a video on CaltechDATA, we can add embed it using just the DOI. This example also shows how you can define a caption using a () label outside of am element, let Bookdown format it, and them embed it Figure 2.1: Staphylococcus aureus Collected by: David Rogers Movie DOI: 10.22002/D1.1463 We also provide a method for embeddig video files locally, if you want the book to work offline.
