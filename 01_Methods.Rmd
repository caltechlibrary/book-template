# Customization

A lot of customization is conducted in the header of each .Rmd document. The
base file, index.rmd, includes configuration that applies to the entire book.

## Citations and Citation Styles

Bookdown has great support for citations, which are handled with BibTeX files (.bib). 
BibTeX is a reasonably standard reference citation format that can be produced by most reference managers and online services. 
This template includes a bibliography file AtlasBibTeX.bib as an example.

References are handled in the bibliography section of the YAML header. You'll
see the following in he header of index.rmd:

'''bibliography: AtlasBibTeX.bib'''

Let's open the `AtlasBibTeX.bib` file and see what it looks like.  You'll see
citation information about each article in groups indicated by a document type
tag, e.g., `@article`, followed by a unique citation key (typically the last
name of an author and the year of publication, e.g. Young_2015), followed by
citation information. We use the **@** symbol to indicate a reference, so
references in test look like `@Castro_2017`.

The citation style defaults to Chicago.  If you want a different citation
style, you can download a csl style file from the
[Zotero style registry](https://www.zotero.org/styles).  Download your favorite
citation style and put it in your directory. You add the citation
style file by using the csl section of the YAML (this is a new section, like
bibliography):

```
csl: american-chemical-society.csl
```

## Bookdown Specific Features

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(introduction). 
If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g.,
Chapter \@ref(customization).

## Including Code and Images

We include images in a directory in the project (say 'img'), and include them
using the include_graphics function like so:

### Schematic: Bactofilin {-#Bactofilin}
```{R}
knitr::include_graphics('img/3_6_1.gif')
```

[*PDB: 6RIB*](http://rcsb.org/structure/6RIB)
Bactofilins are found in many species of bacteria and archaea, suggesting that they perform diverse (and currently unknown) functions. They polymerize into very stable filaments with a triangular beta-helical structure, like this one from *Thermus thermophilus* [@deng2019]. Bactofilin filaments lack two hallmarks of actin- and tubulin-based cytoskeletal elements: polarity and dynamic assembly/disassembly. In this way, they are similar to intermediate filaments in eukaryotic cytoskeletons.

## LaTeX

You can embed any LaTeX directly in the document. 

Inline LaTeX equations can be written in a pair of dollar signs using the LaTeX syntax, e.g., $f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$

Math expressions of the display style can be written in a pair of double dollar signs, e.g., $$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$$

## Caltech Custom Features

If you have a video on CaltechDATA, we can add embed it using just the DOI. This example also shows how you can define a caption using a \(\) label outside of am element, let Bookdown format it, and them embed it

(ref:1-1) [Staphylococcus aureus](#methods) Collected by: David Rogers Movie DOI: [10.22002/D1.1463](https://doi.org/10.22002/D1.1463)

```{R 1-1, echo=FALSE, screenshot.alt='movie_stills/1_1.png' , fig.cap= '(ref:1-1)'}
library(doivideo)
doivideo('10.22002/D1.1463',0,'movie_stills/1_1.png')
```

We also provide a method for embeddig video files locally, if you want the book to work offline.

```{R 1-1-embed, echo=FALSE, screenshot.alt='movie_stills/1_1.png' , fig.cap= '(ref:1-1)'}
library(embedvideo)
embedvideo('videos/1_1_Saureus_480p.mp4')
 

```
