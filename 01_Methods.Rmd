## Bookdown Specific Features

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(introduction). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).

[*PDB: 6RIB*](http://rcsb.org/structure/6RIB)
Bactofilins are found in many species of bacteria and archaea, suggesting that they perform diverse (and currently unknown) functions. They polymerize into very stable filaments with a triangular beta-helical structure, like this one from *Thermus thermophilus* [@deng2019]. Bactofilin filaments lack two hallmarks of actin- and tubulin-based cytoskeletal elements: polarity and dynamic assembly/disassembly. In this way, they are similar to intermediate filaments in eukaryotic cytoskeletons.

## Caltech Custom Features

If you have a video on CaltechDATA, we can add embed it using just the DOI. This example also shows how you can define a caption using a \(\) label outside of am element, let Bookdown format it, and them embed it

(ref:1-1) [Staphylococcus aureus](#methods) Collected by: David Rogers Movie DOI: [10.22002/D1.1463](https://doi.org/10.22002/D1.1463)

```{R 1-1, echo=FALSE, screenshot.alt='movie_stills/1_1.png' , fig.cap= '(ref:1-1)'}
library(doivideo)
doivideo('10.22002/D1.1463',0,'movie_stills/1_1.png')
```

We also provide a method for embeddig video files locally, if you want the book to work offline.

```{R 1-1-embed, echo=FALSE, screenshot.alt='movie_stills/1_1.png' , fig.cap= '(ref:1-1)'}
library(embedvideo)
embedvideo('videos/1_1_Saureus_480p.mp4')
 

```
