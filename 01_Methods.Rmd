# Customization

A lot of customization is conducted in the header of each .Rmd document. The
base file, index.Rmd, includes configuration that applies to the entire book. There is also a _output.yml file that has more customization and configuration options.

## Citations and Citation Styles

Bookdown has great support for citations, which are handled with BibTeX files (.bib). 
BibTeX is a reasonably standard reference citation format that can be produced by most reference managers and online services. 
This template includes a bibliography file AtlasBibTeX.bib as an example.

References are handled in the bibliography section of the YAML header. You'll
see the following in he header of index.rmd:

'''bibliography: AtlasBibTeX.bib'''

Let's open the `AtlasBibTeX.bib` file and see what it looks like.  You'll see
citation information about each article in groups indicated by a document type
tag, e.g., `@article`, followed by a unique citation key (typically the last
name of an author and the year of publication, e.g. Young_2015), followed by
citation information. We use the @ symbol to indicate a reference, so
references in text look like `@Castro_2017`.

The citation style defaults to Chicago.  If you want a different citation
style, you can download a csl style file from the
[Zotero style registry](https://www.zotero.org/styles).  The template includes `springer-socpsych-brackets.csl` sas an example. You add the citation
style file by using the csl section of the YAML like:

```
csl: aspringer-socpsych-brackets.csl
```

## Bookdown Specific Features

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(introduction). 
If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g.,
Chapter \@ref(customization).

## Including Code and Images

You can include computer code directly in your document, and it will be executed before the document is generated. You indicate that you're including code by using three back ticks ```, and then brackets \{r chunk-label, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'A figure caption.'}\} with the programming language. Next comes a label for the code chunk, and specific options for how the code is displayed. For example, this code chunk with do some basic math and make a simple plot in R.

```{r chunk-label, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'A figure caption.'}
1 + 1
rnorm(10)  # 10 random numbers
plot(dist ~ speed, cars)  # a scatterplot
```

The echo option defines whether both the input and output is shown. If we change echo to TRUE we can see all the source code

```{r chunk-label-true, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = 'A figure caption.'}
1 + 1
rnorm(10)  # 10 random numbers
plot(dist ~ speed, cars)  # a scatterplot
```

We include images in a directory in the project (say 'img'), and add them into the document using a code chunk and the include_graphics function like `knitr::include_graphics('img/3_6_1.gif')`:

### Schematic: Bactofilin {-#Bactofilin}
```{R}
knitr::include_graphics('img/3_6_1.gif')
```

[*PDB: 6RIB*](http://rcsb.org/structure/6RIB)
Bactofilins are found in many species of bacteria and archaea, suggesting that they perform diverse (and currently unknown) functions. They polymerize into very stable filaments with a triangular beta-helical structure, like this one from *Thermus thermophilus* [@deng2019]. Bactofilin filaments lack two hallmarks of actin- and tubulin-based cytoskeletal elements: polarity and dynamic assembly/disassembly. In this way, they are similar to intermediate filaments in eukaryotic cytoskeletons.

## LaTeX

You can embed any LaTeX directly in the document. 

Inline LaTeX equations can be written in a pair of dollar signs using the LaTeX syntax, e.g., $f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$

Math expressions of the display style can be written in a pair of double dollar signs, e.g., $$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$$

## Caltech Custom Features

If you have a video on CaltechDATA, we can add embed it using just the DOI. This example also shows how you can define a caption using a \(ref\) label outside of am element, let Bookdown format it, and them embed it.

(ref:1-1) [Staphylococcus aureus](#methods) Collected by: David Rogers Movie DOI: [10.22002/D1.1463](https://doi.org/10.22002/D1.1463)

```{R 1-1, echo=FALSE, screenshot.alt='movie_stills/1_1.png' , fig.cap= '(ref:1-1)'}
library(doivideo)
doivideo('10.22002/D1.1463',0,'movie_stills/1_1.png')
```

We also provide a method for embedding video files locally, if you want the book to work offline.

```{R 1-1-embed, echo=FALSE, screenshot.alt='movie_stills/1_1.png' , fig.cap= '(ref:1-1)'}
library(embedvideo)
embedvideo('videos/1_1_Saureus_480p.mp4')
 

```
